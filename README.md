# Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website created using HTML and CSS. It includes sections like Home, About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact. The goal of this project is to practice front-end development and showcase my work as a Diploma in Computer Engineering student who aims to become a Web Developer.
